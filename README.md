### Hi there 👋
My name is **Ardavan Khalij** and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Kashan.<br/>
I'm working with various programming languages such as Python, Swift, C, C++, Javascript, and Typescript. I am also looking forward to studying master's and Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, and I hope I can give you wonderful news from myself.<br/><br/>
I’m currently working on my Bachelor's Thesis at the University of Kashan under the supervision of Dr.Vahidipour from the Computer engineering department of the University of Kashan. You may find it interesting.<br/><br/>
I’m currently learning Javascript for my new projects.<br/><br/>
